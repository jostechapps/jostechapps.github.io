<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how Image Tools (the “App”) collects, uses and protects
information when you use our mobile application. By installing or using the App, you
agree to the practices described in this policy.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
The App is designed to let you resize, compress, convert, remove the background of,
and apply filters to images. The majority of operations are performed locally on your
device. We do not require you to create an account and do not collect personally
identifying information such as your name, email address, or phone number.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Images and Files:</strong> When you choose an image from your device or take
        a new photo with the camera, the App processes that image entirely on your
        device. The processed image is saved locally, and you may share it via the
        Android share sheet. We do not upload your images to any server.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Device Permissions:</strong> The App requests access to your device’s camera
        and storage only to allow you to select photos, capture new images, and save
        edited images. The app does not scan or access other files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Advertising Data:</strong> The App uses Google’s Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob).
        According to Google, the SDK may collect IP address, usage data, diagnostic data,
        and device identifiers for advertising, analytics and fraud prevention.
        All data is encrypted in transit.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Providing Core Functionality:</strong> Permissions allow image editing
        features to work properly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Displaying Ads:</strong> Banner ads help support development and maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> Anonymous diagnostic data is used to
        improve stability and detect abuse.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> Provides advertisements. Data collection
        is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Share Plus:</strong> Used to invoke the Android share sheet. We do not receive
        any data about how or where you share.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Permissions Explanation</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Take photos within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Read Media Images / Read External Storage:</strong> Select images for editing.</li>
    <li><strong>Write External Storage:</strong> Save edited images.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet and Network State:</strong> Load ads only.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID:</strong> Used for personalized ads (can be reset by user).</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention and Security</h2>

<p>
The App does not store your images or personal data on external servers. All processing
happens locally. Data collected by Google is encrypted in transit and retained according
to Google’s policies.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If such data is
discovered, it will be deleted.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this policy from time to time. Continued use of the App means you accept
any updates.
